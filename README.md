# Potion Sauce
A very small mod that only adds a single feature: Potion Saucing!

Potion Saucing can be done by putting a Potion in the top slot of a Brewing Stand, and any food in the bottom 3 slots. This will apply a weakened version of the potion to each of the foods, which you will gain when you eat the food! The status effects that the food will give are displayed in the tooltip (except for negative status effects, if you want to be sneaky).
