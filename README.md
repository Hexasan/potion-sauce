# Potion Sauce
A very small mod that only adds a single feature: Potion Saucing!

Potion Saucing can be done by putting a Potion in the top slot of a Brewing Stand, and any food in the bottom 3 slots. This will apply a weakened version of the potion to each of the foods, which you will gain when you eat the food!
